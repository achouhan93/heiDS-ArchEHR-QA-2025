I am 48 years old. On February 20, I passed out, was taken to the hospital, and had two other episodes. I have chronic kidney disease with creatine around 1.5. I had anemia and hemoglobin was 10.3. I was in ICU 8 days and discharged in stable condition. My doctor performed a cardiac catherization. I had no increase in cardiac enzymes and an ECHO in the hospital showed 25% LVEF.

My dad has been killed recently by doctors treating him in icu for bacterial and fungal pneumonia. First my dad was admitted into ICU in August after seeing his lungs xray and he was put in ICU for 5 days then shifted to room then in 10 days he was discharged. After coming home we thought he was recovering well but on September 30 again he felt severe shortness in breath so when took to the Hispital, doctor said that the lung infection came again and this time its both bacterial and fungal and so my dad was directly admitted into ICU with ventilators support. The ICU patient dies on october 13 and the reason the doctor said is Sudden Cardiac Arrest and it can happen anytime. Other health complications of my dad are diabetes, hypertension, and AML. My question is if the Dr fail to diagonise the lung infection in time? I felt the culture test for presense of bacterial/fungal infection was done late and reports came very late.

My mother n law had a surgery about 10 years ago, replacing all veins from top of leg to foot. Although that surgery has done well the doctors have had her on blood thinner ever since. Just recently she has gone to hospital due to a fall and they found a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the brain. They took her off the blood thinner, kept in icu for 3 weeks. We asked what would happen now to the original vein surgery (since stopping Coumadin). Are there any specific instructions about stopping Coumadin?

A friend went to the emergency room this past Monday morning with severe flu-like symptoms. On Thursday, she was diagnosed with meningitis. On Friday afternoon, it was determined to be viral, and she was rereleased with instructions to stay home and rest for 1 week. Yesterday she was beginning to feel better, but is not feeling as well today as yesterday. Is this fall back today a normal part of the recovery process, or Is it a sign of a possible relapse? Should she perhaps be gotten back to the hospitals? Thanks for your time.

I spent yesterday in the ER with thumping heart beats i.e. palpitations. I had all blood work, a full panel, enzymes etc., EKG, chest x-ray, and TSH because I&#8217;ve had a total thyroidectomy. In October of last year, I had a walking stress test and all the same tests then, all of which are normal, showing no sign of any cardiac issues. My palpitations are benign, I&#8217;m told. Fine, how can I slow them or stop them without some antiarrhythmic meds? Of course, even though I&#8217;ve been told I&#8217;m fine, I feel them and sometimes worry which triggers the stress bug, then my chest gets tight, I have to take deep breaths to get out from under the stress. Is there anything I can do to relieve them? They really started when I started taking levothyroxine.

1 week ago I was in a car accident. Now I have diarrhea and vomiting. it wasn&#8217;t a car that hit us, it was a big tree that went through our radiator and engine. I had neck pain at hospital.  I seemed fine, but now I am vomiting and have diarrhea. Should i go back to ER? I have dr&#8217;s appointment on Thursday.

After an ER visit for a bladder infection, I started to feel anxiety and rapid heartbeat. I have a history of panic attacks, but could these symptoms all be due to anxiety or is something wrong with my heart?

I have a history of panic attacks. two weeks ago I went to ER for a bladder infection.  The doctor asked if I had irregular heartbeats or a-fib, which lead me getting very panicky. He decided to do an ekg, and it was normal, but after that day i keep thinking on it. now keep feeling rapid heartbeats and palpitations plus lot of chest discomfort. IT SCARES THE DAYLIGHTS of me. can all this be overthinking about what happened that day or can something be wrong with my heart ?

My sister was hospitalized for a headache and a room spinning sensation. She was told it was a migraine and was given sumatriptan. The headache has since improved but she is still dizzy. Could migraine cause such a spinning sensation?

Last week my 61 yr old sister woke up with a terrible headache and was not able to walk because she felt the room was spinning. She went to Intermountain Medical Center in Salt lake City, Utah and was admitted. After many tests, she was told she was having a migraine headache and was sent home with a prescription for sumatriptan. The headache has gotten better, but she is still very dizzy. So what is the dizziness from I never heard of a migraine that can cause your head to spin like that.
